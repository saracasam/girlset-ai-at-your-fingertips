# Girlset — AI at Your Fingertips  
**Workshop Script**  

---

## Slide 1  
Hi everyone, I’m Sara. I have a bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and a master’s in EdTech.  
I’m passionate about making technology more ethical and inclusive. I created this workshop for Girlset because I believe everyone, especially young women, deserve a say in how AI is built and used.  

Today isn’t about technical jargon. It’s about asking questions, thinking critically, and exploring how we can shape technology to work better for everyone.

Interesting, right? We’ll revisit this at the end.”
